              { question: "Do you integrate with our CI/CD pipeline?", answer: "Yes, we do. We work with GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, and most major CI tools. Tests run automatically on every push, PR, or deployment." },
              { question: "Can you test across browsers and devices?", answer: "Yes, we can! Our AI runs tests parallelly across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and mobile viewports. You get complete cross-browser coverage, and no time penalty." },
              { question: "What if we already have some tests written?", answer: "That's not a problem at all! We'll gladly work with what you have. If your existing tests are solid, we'll build on them. If they could use some work, we'll help you clean them up and fine-tune them" },
              { question: 'What does "40% faster" actually mean?', answer: "Simply put, what usually takes 12 months with traditional QA approaches takes just 7 months with us. We save time by letting our AI handle the repetitive work (test generation, execution, data creation) while our engineers focus on judgment calls and compliance documentation" },

                answer: (
                  <>
                    We typically work on monthly engagements starting with a focused pilot engagement. Pricing
                    depends entirely on the scope of work and complexity involved.
