              { question: "How fast can you get started?", answer: "Most teams are up and running within 2-3 weeks. We start with a discovery call to understand your product and compliance requirements, then move into a focused pilot engagement." },
              { question: "How do you handle HIPAA compliance?", answer: "We never use real patient data. Our AI-generated synthetic test data is realistic enough to catch edge cases but contains no traces of PHI. We sign BAAs and follow HIPAA security requirements throughout our process, so compliance is never an issue" },
              { question: "Have you worked with EMR/EHR integrations?", answer: "Yes, we have! We've tested integrations with Epic, Cerner, Allscripts, athenahealth, and custom hospital systems. We've also worked with HL7, FHIR APIs, and insurance claim workflows" },
              { question: "Can you help with FDA documentation?", answer: "Yes. We provide documented test coverage, traceability matrices, and verification records that support FDA submissions. Our built-in documentation is designed to answer the questions reviewers actually ask." },
              { question: 'What does "40% faster" actually mean?', answer: "Simply put, what usually takes 12 months with traditional QA approaches takes just 7 months with us. We save time by letting our AI handle the repetitive work (test generation, execution, data creation) while our engineers focus on judgment calls and compliance documentation" },
